This was a project I completed during University. The purpose of the website is to showcase Call of Duty news and updates.

The index page acts as the landing page that users will see when opening the website. The other pages are linked to this through nav bars and cards. 
This website attempts to utilise '@medial' commands to accomodate different screen sizes.

The languages used for this projects are HTML, CSS and Javascript using Virtual Studio Code as the source code editor.
